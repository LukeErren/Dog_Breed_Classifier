# Dog_Breed_Classifier

This repository contains the files for the Udacity capstone project Dog Breed Classifier. The original Udacity's repo can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification). I've choosen to write an application instead of the blog post. The application is also included in this repository.

# Project Overview

## Files
* dog_app.ipynb - The Jupiter Notebook for training the model
* breed.py - The functions for recognise the breed. Used by the web application
* run.py - the web application

## Directories

* data - directory with the trained data, used by the web application
* Test_Images - contains the images who where used for test the algorithm 

## Installation
